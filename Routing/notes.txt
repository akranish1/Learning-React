React Router is a routing library for React applications. 
It enables navigation without reloading the page, making the application faster and more dynamic

Types of routing:
Type	            Use Case	                                Example Path
BrowserRouter	    Most common,clean URLs	                    /about
HashRouter	        For static servers (like GitHub Pages)	    /#/about
Nested Routing	    Pages within pages (like dashboard tabs)	/dashboard/profile
Dynamic Routing	    When URL changes with ID or slug	        /user/101
Redirects	        Navigate on action (login, button click)after login â†’ /dashboard
Fallback Route	    Catch-all for 404 pages	                    /some/invalid/path


What is declarative Routing ?
You define your routes using JSX components, and React Router handles the rest automatically.
//<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>
//
You donâ€™t manually tell React to check the URL or mount/unmount components â€” React Router handles it.

//const url = window.location.pathname;
if (url === "/about") {
  // manually render about component
}
//ðŸš« You donâ€™t write low-level URL matching logic.

why routing is imp->
1. Multiple pages in one app
2. Cleaner user experience
3. URL reflects where you are
4. Easy to manage content
